<h1>Things4U - Internet of Things for You</h1>
<p>Welcome to the dark side of Things4U, the cave where I like to work on LoRa sensor development and applications to put them to use.</p>
<p>On this page you will find documentation of the software projects on github (http://github.org/things4u), which ranges from&nbsp;Lora Sensor development to use cases etc for this technology. This page is ALWAYS under development, so not all projects I am working on will be documented yet.</p>
<h1>Hardware Guide</h1>
<p>Explaining how to build LoRa sensors, wire and connect and installation. Click &lt;<a href="HardwareGuide/hardware_guide.html">HERE</a>&gt; to go to the Hardware Guide. All Software is found on http://github.com/things4u</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arduino based sensors</li>
  <li>ESP8266 based sensors</li>
  <li>Single Channel Gateway</li>
</ul>
<h1>Application Guide</h1>
<p>If there are new applications to share, I will publish them in the Application Guide.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Measuring your gateway range</li>
